# PythonForcTry
My try at calculating and plotting FORCS with python!

Some time ago I wrote this program to read, calculate and plot first order reversal curves (FORCs) from a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at the lab.

Here, you will find an example FORC file of an array of nickel nanowires inside an alumina template and the python script used to plot the FORCs.

The script was originally written in python 2.7 so some print parenthesis look out of place and I have added some comments to it

Hope this helps anyone who is trying to understand and implement a FORC script in python

I'll keep improving this readme file
